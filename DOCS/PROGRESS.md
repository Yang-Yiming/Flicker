- [x] `model.rs` — Flicker struct, Status enum, frontmatter serde, file parsing
- [x] `storage.rs` — iCloud path resolution, FLICKER_DIR override, read/write/list/delete, conflict detection
- [x] `commands/add.rs` — create flicker with 8-char hex ID
- [x] `commands/list.rs` — sorted by date, filter by `--status`, hides deleted by default
- [x] `commands/show.rs` — display single flicker metadata + body
- [x] `commands/delete.rs` — soft delete (sets status to deleted)
- [x] `commands/search.rs` — case-insensitive full-text search
- [x] `commands/status.rs` — counts by status + conflict file reporting

- [x] `main.rs` — no-args launches TUI
- [x] TUI command bar — `:` triggers Command mode; `add`/`delete`/`search` dispatch; unknown cmd shows error message
- [x] TUI command autocomplete — `:` shows all candidates; typing filters; ↓/Tab navigate; Enter accepts & executes
